- save after you are done

3. Move to .github/workflows/main.yml and make the necessary changes:

***Changes to make***
  - change the email to your own primary email
  - change the user name to your user name.

congratulations on completion. 🎉 🎊

Now one thing is left: keeping the secret;
> once you are done and everything is running smoothly, be sure to delete the `.secreto` so that no one
> Finds the secret 😅, *this is optional but recommended*

To achieve that, click on the secreto directory then, navigate to the three option dots
